# 34-key Colemak ZMK Configuration for Cradio (Ferris Sweep)

My layout for the awesome [Ferris Sweep][ferris-sweep], a custom 34-key wireless keyboard (17 keys per half).
<!-- TODO: Add a picture of my keyboard once it's all finished -->

This ZMK configuration is Nix-based, and uses [zmk-nix][zmk-nix] (Thanks [@lilyinstarlight][@lilyinstarlight] for the awesome project).

I used the awesome [Keymap Drawer](https://keymap-drawer.streamlit.app/) to generate a visualization of my layout below:
